<Configuration status="WARN">
    <!--
    This is a minimal default configuration that is bundled with any GOR build.

    When running GorServer, GorWorker or any other process that should log to a file, a more robust configuration
    should be used. See logback-gorservices.xml

    To use a different configuration file, specify the following JVM config option (pointing to the correct path):
    java -Dlogback.configurationFile=path_to/custom-logback-config.xml
    -->

    <!--
    Add a context listener that will change the log level of JUL according to the SLF4J log level. This will ensure
    that JUL will not be performing needless work for logging statements that are eventually disabled in SLF4J.
